This ESP32 project implements several tasks on core 0 and core 1 with varying task priorities.  We do this to learn about Rate Monotonic theory.  We built this
in Rust for memory safety.  You should still run cargo clippy on the code, as there are things that could be optimized.  Hope this project can help you out.
